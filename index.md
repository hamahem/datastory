<p style="text-align: justify;">As it’s often said, markets have short memories. Fortunes are made, empires rise, and just as quietly they fall into obscurity. On the NASDAQ, thousands of companies have walked this familiar path, yet the grand patterns that bind their stories together often remain hidden beneath daily price movements and quarterly headlines. We celebrate today’s tech titans, but what of the giants that once ruled the exchange and have since faded from memory?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Like explorers sifting through the ruins of ancient civilizations, we turn our gaze to the past not to relive old triumphs, but to uncover the deeper forces that shape success and failure. Are market leaders solitary emperors commanding entire eras, or do true dynasties rise through the combined strength of many powerful players? And when one empire collapses, does another inevitably rise to take its place?</p>

> **Do stock markets form dynasties, and if so, can we trace their rise, reign, and eventual decline?**

<p style="text-align: justify;">By clustering decades of NASDAQ history into shared patterns of growth and decay, we seek to uncover the hidden lineages of market power. From identifying each dynasty’s Golden Age to tracking the shifting balance of leadership within them, this project ventures beneath surface-level trends to reveal the ancient forces still shaping modern finance. Beneath the noise of prices and time, the echoes of forgotten empires may still guide the future.</p>
