  0: "This dynasty lived a short life (1980-1982). Its power in energy seemed to have kept barely alive. Unfortunately, its downfall arrives when it decides to transition its sectoral indentity to Information and Technology, even though it was the wealthiest of them all. And almost more than half of its poulation are prone to being delisted.",
  1: "The D1 dynasty is the longest living dynasty and its shows a rich bookkeeping. Observe the mosaic of its main sector transitions. Its had a rough start. It has survived many catastrophes of the NASDAQ. For example, NASDAQ saw the market crash of 2008 and consequently, the D1 dyansty with its main sector being Finance, dipped in market cap wealth. There was a very low ratio of firms that were going to thrive in the NASDAQ territory. But later, at the beginning of the year 2000s, the D1 dynasty started a 'cleansing' and banished all firms to be delisted. This seems to be the reason it survived and thrived anear the end of the NASDAQ history.",
  2: "The D2 dynasty lived from 1980 to 2002. It shows a diverse mosaic of its main sectors. The constant equal ratios of listed and delisted may be the reason for its downfall. It never found away to only keep the strongest.",
  3: "The d3 dynasty lived only 4 years, from 1981 to 1984. During those short years, it was mostly comprised of the weaker firms. Almost 70% of the total firms were going to be delisted at some point in the NASDAQ timeline. It was unable to evolve and adapt by keeping its main sector as Energy. Ultimately, leading to its demise.",
  4: "The D4 dynasty lived a modest life, from 1983 to 1998. Throughout its lifetime, it was greatly populated by the weaker firms. An attempt by the stronger firms to overtake the dynasty at the beginning of 1981 failed, but the dynasty still lived a relatively long reign in the NASADAQ territory.",
  5: "The D5 dynasty lived a noble and honorous reign. It rose immensely in market cap wealth, especially after 2017. It also shows a diverse mosaic of primary sectors throughout its life. This dynasty also shows 'purity' in its population, increasing the divide between the listed and delisted firms. In 2024, only 1.7% of the weaker firms remained. That is a 96.85% decrease of the weaker firms since its birth in 1997.",
  6: "The D6 dynasty comprised in majority of the stronger firms, lived from 2001 to 2017. The divide between the strong and the weak slowly grew throughout NASDAQ history. Its market cap wealth experience many ups and downs. Ultimately, its fate was sealed in 2017. An exception among the dynasties, it had every quality to survive...",
  7: "The D7 dynasty came along as surprise in 2016 and lived to 2024. Starting off as a quite 'pure' dynasty, it rose in power rapidly and competed in wealth with the D5 dynasty. It stayed for most of its life, a master in Financials until 2023 where we see a transition of sectors. A decison to keep up with with its rivals in the NASDAQ territory.",
